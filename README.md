# Carpentry-E-commerce-Website
I am currently designing a website for a relative's carpentry business to enhance online sales and improve the visual appeal of their existing site.

In this project, I am using CSS for styling and JavaScript to add interactive elements for a better user experience.

Additionally, I am managing form inputs from users to the website owner with PHP, which includes setting up email subscriptions and handling commission requests.
